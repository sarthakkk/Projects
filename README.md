In This  project I Have walk through step by step process of how to do exploratory data analysis on a real estate price. I have first got the  banglore home prices dataset from a open source platform . after that I have loaded that data set into pandas data frame and then with the help of pandas and numpy i have cleaned the data by identifying null values in the data sets and by adding  new mean value in it and also drop the rows that were of no use for the analysis , and removed the outliers which were necessary to remove because they usuually create noise in the data sets and then added a new features in the data sets as well and then finally made some clean data visualization  to present the analysis done on data set  During this project cover almost all data analysis concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction. Technology and tools wise this project covers.

Python
Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
Matplotlib for data visualization
Jupyter notebook
